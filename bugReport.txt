📝 Summary  
When adding an addon along with a license, the monthly license price on page 2 "Review & Checkout" and page 3 "Checkout" incorrectly includes the addon price.  

🔄 Steps to Reproduce  
1. Open the cPanel Licenses page (https://store.cpanel.net/store/cpanel-licenses).  
2. Click the "Order Now" button under the selected license.  
3. Enter an IP address (e.g., 192.168.0.1).  
4. Click the "Continue" button.  

❌ Actual Result  
The displayed monthly license price is incorrect. It includes both the license price and the price of the added addon (see attached screenshot: bugScreenshot.png).
Same problem on page 3 "Checkout".

✅ Expected Result  
The monthly license price should reflect only the cost of the selected license, without including any addon prices.
